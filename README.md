# Surfs_Up
## Overview of Surfs Up with Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask

### Purpose
___
The purpose of this analysis was to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures on Oahu for the months of June (Deliverable 1) and December (Deliverable 2).
This analysis is meant to aid in determining whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 
Using queries and the data provided in the starting challenge code, we are able to see average/max/min temperatures to help us make informed decisions.

### Surfs Up Results
___
June & December Data
There are 1,700 observations for the month of June, years 2010 - 2017.
There are 1,517 observations for the month of December, years 2010 - 2017.

* The average recorded temperature in June is ~75 degrees F, which is 4 degrees higher than the average temperature recorded for the month of December.
* From the min, max & mean temperatures, we can infer that June has less variability in temperature fluctuation than December does. Apart from the minimum temperature which drops to 56 F in December, all other values spread across the 2 months are relatively similar.
* Low standard deviation for both months implies a tight set of data, which tells us that in both mohts, Oahu weather does not fluctuate significantly.

### Surfs Up Summary

The months of June and December both hold relatively favorable temperatures for surfing conditions and a steady demand of ice cream. The average temperature for both months only differs by 4 degrees (December lower with 71 F),
however this is not low enough to have a negative impact on either activity.

In an analysis such as this one, variables such as precipitation and wind speed should also be included as these could affect favorable conditions for the selected activities.
Based on precipitation, we could determine the amount of people willing to go out and get ice cream/enjoy the warm beach weather. 
Based on wind speed, we could determine how many would find it favorable to go out and actually suft. Wave swells depend on these factors (precipitation/weather/wind speed) and would influence decision making here.

Temperature should not be the only variable analysed when making an informed decision about the proposed task.
